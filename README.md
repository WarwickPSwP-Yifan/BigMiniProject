This code is for the general cases under the constraint of 'collisions in the box at one stage happen as many as possible', it can be seen as the verification to the general cases, and it can be used as the verification of the special cases that '2 different non-zero, 1 zero coordinates of the initial tuple, will finally form a loop'
